while there are tokens to be read do:
    read a token.
    if the token is a number, then:
        push it to the output queue.
    if the token is a function then:
        push it onto the operator stack 
    if the token is an operator, then:
        while ((there is a function at the top of the operator stack)
               or (there is an operator at the top of the operator stack with greater precedence)
               or (the operator at the top of the operator stack has equal precedence and is left associative))
              and (the operator at the top of the operator stack is not a left parenthesis):
            pop operators from the operator stack onto the output queue.
        push it onto the operator stack.
    if the token is a left paren (i.e. "("), then:
        push it onto the operator stack.
    if the token is a right paren (i.e. ")"), then:
        while the operator at the top of the operator stack is not a left paren:
            pop the operator from the operator stack onto the output queue.
        /* if the stack runs out without finding a left paren, then there are mismatched parentheses. */

/* After while loop, if operator stack not null, pop everything to output queue */
if there are no more tokens to read then:
    while there are still operator tokens on the stack:
