;;  duart_irq: DUART ISR
;;   This block is responsible for receving and transmitting characters using
;;   two fixed 128 byte buffers (right now just channel A). It is also responsible
;;   for handling the counter. It will stop the counter if it has triggered an
;;   interrupt and sets a delay flag to indicate the counter has reached zero.
;;   The block is part of the ISR (interrupt service routine) so no registers are preserved here.
;;   They have already been pushed to the stack by the main ISR.
;;
;;   Returned Values: none
